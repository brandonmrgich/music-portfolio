# Music Portfolio

A full-stack music portfolio web application for showcasing tracks, audio comparisons, and more. Built with React, Node.js, and AWS S3.

**This project prioritizes UX and audio interaction over generalized backend architecture. It is intentionally opinionated and single-tenant.**
